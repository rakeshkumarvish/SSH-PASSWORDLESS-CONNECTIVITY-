PASSWORDLESS CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN TWO OR MORE INSTANCE

STEPS 1
create two or more instances in the same zone.
1) MASTER INSTANCE
2) NODES INSTANCE
security group >> ALL TRAFFIC FROM ANYWHERE

 LOGIN TO MASTER INSTANCE 
 # sudo su -> Login as a root user
 # passwd  -> set the password for the user
 # ssh-keygen -> it will download the sshkey
 # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config -> Open this file
 =) change password authentication to Yes.
 =) save the file and exit.
 # systemctl restart sshd

 
 LOGIN TO NODES INSTANCES
  
  # sudo su -> Login as a root user
  # passwd  -> set the password for the user
  # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config -> Open this file
  =) change password authentication to Yes.
  =) save the file and exit.
  # systemctl restart sshd

 NOTE: DONOT KEEP THE SAME PASSWORD FOR BOTH THE INSTANCES
 
 LOGIN TO MASTER INSTANCE AGAIN 
 
 # cd .ssh ->  moved to ssh folder
 # ll
 =) check id.rsa.pub file is exit
 # vi idrsa.pub 
 =) copy the file 
 -> SAVE AND EXIT

 LOGIN TO NODES INSTANCES AGAIN
 # cd .ssh
 #ll
 =) check the authorized file is there.
 # vi authorized file
 =) At the end of file paste the id.rsa.pub file content.
  
 PLEASE DO ALL THIS WITHOUT FILE !!!!
 
 NOW GO TO MASTER INSTANCES
# ssh 172.0.0.1 -> note enter your priv ip address of nodes instance
